Modify BattleViewModel.cs to use Player model.

Requirements:
• Add property Player of type Player.
• In constructor, initialize Player = new Player().
• Replace PlayerHP references with Player.HP.
• When damage taken:
   - Subtract from Player.HP
   - If Player.HP <= 0, append "You were defeated!"
• Bind ProgressBar in BattleView.xaml to Player.HP and set Maximum to Player.MaxHP.
• Add TODO: // Later - persist Player object between battles

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
