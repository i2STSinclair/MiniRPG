Update MainViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• Add a public property: Player CurrentPlayer { get; set; } = new Player();
• When creating BattleViewModel, pass the same Player instance:
   var battleVM = new BattleViewModel(CurrentPlayer);
• In BattleViewModel, modify constructor to accept a Player parameter and assign it.
• Ensure Player HP and stats carry over between battles.
• Add TODO: // Later - add save/load player data to file system

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
