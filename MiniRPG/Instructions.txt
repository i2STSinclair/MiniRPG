Update MapViewModel and MainViewModel.

Requirements:
• In MapViewModel, modify StartBattleCommand to raise an event or callback when executed, e.g. OnStartBattle(string location).
• In MainViewModel, subscribe to that event.
• When triggered:
   - Create a new BattleViewModel()
   - Optionally pass the selected location name or seed to it
   - Set CurrentViewModel = that BattleViewModel
   - AddLog($"Entering battle at {location}")
• Add TODO: // Later - fade transition and music change between map and battle

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
