Edit BattleViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• When the player defeats an enemy (EnemyHP <= 0):
   - int exp = new Random().Next(5, 15);
   - bool leveledUp = Player.GainExperience(exp);
   - Append $"You gained {exp} experience!"
   - If leveledUp, append $"You reached level {Player.Level}! Your stats increased."
• Call BattleEnded?.Invoke("Victory") afterward.
• Add TODO: // Later - include loot drops and enemy-specific EXP scaling

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
