Create SaveLoadService.cs in the Services folder.

Requirements:
• Use System.Text.Json
• Implement two static methods:
   - SavePlayer(Player player, string filePath = "player_save.json")
   - LoadPlayer(string filePath = "player_save.json") → returns Player or null
• SavePlayer serializes Player object to JSON and writes it to file.
• LoadPlayer reads file if it exists, deserializes JSON to Player, and returns it.
• Add proper exception handling (try/catch with Debug.WriteLine).
• Add TODO: // Extend to save inventory, map progress, and settings later
