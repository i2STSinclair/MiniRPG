You are GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio 2022.

Open BattleView.xaml and add a basic overlay.

Requirements:
• Add a TextBlock centered over the UI (use a Grid with overlapping layers)
• Bind its Text to a new BattleResult property in BattleViewModel
• Use large bold font and color (e.g., LimeGreen for victory, Red for defeat)
• Visibility bound to IsBattleOver (use BooleanToVisibilityConverter)
• Add comments:
   <!-- TODO: Replace overlay with animated fade-in/out scene transition -->
   <!-- TODO: Replace static text with art-based "Victory" screen later -->

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
