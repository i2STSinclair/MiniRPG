Create Item.cs in the Models folder.

Requirements:
• Define a public class Item with properties:
   - string Name
   - string Description
   - string Type (e.g. "Consumable", "Material", "Weapon")
   - int Value (for gold or sell price)
• Add constructor for quick setup.
• Add static method GetSampleItems() returning a few basic items:
   new Item("Potion", "Restores 10 HP", "Consumable", 25),
   new Item("Slime Goo", "Sticky residue from a defeated slime.", "Material", 5)
• Add TODO: // Expand with item effects and rarity later
