You are GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio 2022.

Create BattleViewModel.cs in the ViewModels folder.

Requirements:
• Inherit from BaseViewModel
• Add ObservableCollection<string> CombatLog
• Add three RelayCommands: AttackCommand, DefendCommand, RunCommand
• Each command adds a new line to CombatLog describing what happened (for example: "You attack the enemy for 5 damage!")
• Add simple randomization for damage values using System.Random
• Include TODO comments for future HP tracking and enemy AI
