You are GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio 2022.

Modify BattleViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• Add integer properties:
   - PlayerHP (default 30)
   - EnemyHP (default 20)
   - CurrentEnemy (string)
• Add bool IsBattleOver
• Update AttackCommand:
   1. int dmg = GameService.CalculateDamage();
   2. EnemyHP -= dmg;
   3. Append $"You strike {CurrentEnemy} for {dmg} damage! (Enemy HP: {EnemyHP})"
   4. If EnemyHP <= 0 => Append "You defeated the enemy!" and set IsBattleOver = true.
   5. Else call EnemyAttack().
• Create private method EnemyAttack():
   - int dmg = GameService.CalculateDamage() / 2;
   - PlayerHP -= dmg;
   - Append $"{CurrentEnemy} attacks you for {dmg} damage! (Your HP: {PlayerHP})"
   - If PlayerHP <= 0 => Append "You were defeated!" and set IsBattleOver = true.
• DefendCommand reduces next incoming damage by 50%.
• RunCommand ends battle and appends "You escaped safely."
• Add TODO comment: // Later: Replace integers with full Stat objects for scaling difficulty
