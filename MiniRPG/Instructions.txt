You are GitHub Copilot inside Visual Studio 2022.

Instructions:
1. Build and run the SimpleRPG project.
2. Verify:
   • "Map" and "Battle" buttons switch views.
   • MapView lists locations.
   • Selecting a location + “Fight!” logs a start message.
   • BattleView’s buttons append combat messages.
3. If you encounter errors, let Copilot fix binding or namespace issues automatically.
4. Add TODO comment placeholders at top of MainWindow.xaml:
   <!-- TODO: Add background music, player sprite, enemy sprite, and location art -->

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
