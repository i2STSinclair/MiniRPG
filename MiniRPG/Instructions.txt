Add ReturnToMapCommand in BattleViewModel.cs.

Requirements:
• Initialize ReturnToMapCommand = new RelayCommand(_ => BattleEnded?.Invoke("Return"));
• When executed, logs "Returning to map..." to CombatLog.
• Set IsBattleOver = true to ensure overlay/button visible.
• Add TODO: // Hook this into save/load later so battle results persist

After you finish, update the Readme.md file with the changes.
