## MainWindow.xaml Layout Update

- Replaced the default Grid in MainWindow.xaml with a modern WPF layout for SimpleRPG prototype.
- Added a top MenuBar with two buttons: "Map" and "Battle".
- Inserted a main ContentControl below the MenuBar to switch between MapView and BattleView.
- Added a bottom multi-line, read-only, scrollable TextBox for combat logs/messages.
- Used proper Grid row definitions and named each control for clarity.
- Commented XAML to indicate where images or art assets can be inserted.
